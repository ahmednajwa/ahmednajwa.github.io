<p>“Eveline” is a story written by James Joyce, about a little young girl Eveline who lost her mother, and had a miserable drunk Father. She was left with a young brother to take care of, and herself. She later fell in love with a young man Frank, whom she thinks will change her miserable life if he marries her and take her to Dublin, (where he comes from).My purpose of analyzing the novel, using Voyant is to find out how family relationship is used and also interpreted. I post the text on Voyant, and I found out the most frequent word used is Father, family, Frank, mother and life as it shown here: </p>

<p>I observed the words ‘father’ and ‘home’, I figure out the two words collocated, three times. This indicates to me the frequent use of father and home depicts the story as a family issue. As  shown below.</p>

Similarly, the recurrent use of the word ‘father’ and ‘home’ remain steady, throughout the text. Notably I noted the word ‘used’ also reoccur. This was reveal  in the following figure:
