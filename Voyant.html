<p>One good thing with creative writers, especially short story writers is their language is straightforward and easy to understand, although not necessarily easy to interpret and analyze, For English studies students, whenever you are reading short story, the most crucial aspect is interpreting the words; for me this is difficult. Thanks to Voyant tool, for making it quite easy to interpret frequent words used in writing. For James Joyce, he makes every word count while writing his stories. I selected two text from James Joyce Dubliners, ‘Eveline’ and ‘The Sisters’ , my objective is to make comparative analysis using voyant tool,of both stories, as the two stories revolves on family issues. How did Joyce use words to interpret family relationship in these two different texts, is there any reoccurrence, repetition of words in both texts? The first thing I noticed after inputting the two texts, was that the most frequent words in the corpus: said (40); old (21); aunt (19); used (17); father (16). This frequent words used signifies the two texts circles on family relationship. As shown in the corpus below:</p>

 <p>After noticing this, its gives me the courage to further investigate how Joyce discuss family issue in ‘Eveline’. I use the trends to do close reading for the word father in ‘Eveline’ and ‘old’ in ‘The Sisters’, because they are among the most frequent word used, as its shown below:</p>

<p>From the above trend, ‘said’ is used in the past tense most frequently in ‘The Sisters’ than in ‘Eveline’. This signifies that ‘The Sisters’ portrays the relationship in a community. While on the other hand, the word ‘say’ is used equally in both stories. This encouraged me to further investigate the relationship inside the story, I add the word father to this trend again. Notably, the word father is used most frequently in Eveline, than in ‘The Sisters’. As shown in the data below:<p/>

 <p>The above trend shows the frequent use of father in ‘Eveline’ and this signifies the regular interactions of the family members and interdependent on one another. Also, this indicate implication of the word in the story. However, in both stories, certain words seem to collocates. for example, ‘aunt and said’, ‘father and used’.See data </p>

 <p>Finally, as I decide to take the family approach theory in the interpretation of the two text, thus, based on the voyant tool analysis, I was able to discovered that words related to family were not often mentioned in the two stories, because my expectations was to see words related to family used more frequently, instead, I observed out of the five most frequent words used in the texts only father and aunt are words related to family, whereas the other most frequent word used;  ‘said’ which takes the lead doesn’t imply much relevance to my expectation. Although this my first-time experience using voyant tool, I do think it helped with a clue to look for a start on how to do a comparison of words frequencies and context of the words in literary texts. Because I am certain there are other ways I can explore more with this great tool.
