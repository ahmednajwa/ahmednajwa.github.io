<p>“Eveline” is a short story written by James Joyce, about a little young girl. Eveline who lost her mother,and had a miserable abusive Father with whom she lives. For Eveline,it was a hardwork and also a hardlife,She faces a difficult dilemma: remain at home like a dutiful daughter or leave Dublin with her lover, Frank who is a sailor.She has the assumption, he will change her miserable life.My purpose of choosing this short novel, using Voyant is to get the idea of how cretive writers use characters in writing fiction stories,to depicts the real concept  behind  their storyline.For example, which character best fit in to the story line.After inputing the text on Voyant,I found out the most frequent word used is 'father', 'family', 'Frank', 'mother' and 'life'. This come as expected, because the story revolves n family issues.As shown here in the word cloud: </p>

<p>In this word trend tool, I observed the that these two words; ‘father’ and ‘home’, were somehow collocated, three times. This also indicates to me the frequent use of father and home depicts the story as a family issue. As  shown below.</p>

<p>Similarly, the recurrent use of the word ‘father’ and ‘home’ remain steady, throughout the text. Notably, the word ‘used’ also reoccur. This was reveal in the following figure:</p>

 <p>From the above interpretation of voyant tools, reveals James Joyce clever use of characters in the story. But as a Literary critic student, in what I observe as a criticsm, is that the protoganist was not mention often, instead Frank seems to be the main leading character in this case, as he was mention more often than Eveline. This is the most interesting part of this great tool; as it helps in figuring out how writers use words from the begining to the end of their text, and also how the words reoccur. This would eventually help future researchers to easily identify how stuff like this are used when writing fiction stories.For me, I didnt dive into the graph part of voyant (not in good in mathematics),and I think that is where many things about the text will be discovered. My biggest challenge working with voyant is when fetching the corpus, after uploading everything on github, and it looks everything was fine, the next minute I could not retrieve the corpus I uploaded, after making several attempts, it did not show up Untill the nezt day. I realized that it from their end, not mine.<p>
